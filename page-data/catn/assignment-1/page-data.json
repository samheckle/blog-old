Basically what I did was create a horror generator that separates these basic parts to create a new story.</p>\n<h2>Some Outputs</h2>\n<p>“Dad…,the man that’s been standing outside my window is gone,” I whispered shakily into the phone. </p>\n<p>I squeezed my eyes shut and told myself it was all in my head, but the slimy footprints staining the carpet the next morning made it clear I would never be allowed to forget what I’ve done.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As I was falling asleep, my girlfriend asked if she could be blunt with me, and groggily I said “Yes.” </p>\n<p>The other thing I’ve learned is that it’s super hard to hold a cat down with one hand while holding a melonballer in the other.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I tightened my legs around him, letting out a shudder of delight, and gazed deeply into his eyes as I brought my mouth down to his. </p>\n<p>“She’s my half-sister now” I said as I dropped my axe</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Using the Reddit API</h2>\n<p>I created this in JavaScript using a Node.js backend. Specifically the tools I used were this integration of <a href=\"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/snoowrap/blob/master/src/README.md\">snoowrap</a> which allows me to use a JS port of the python based api. </p>\n<p>From there, I had to create an authorization token to allow the REST requests to go through using the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps\">reddit dev app console</a></p>\n<p>I created my own environment file to host these variables. Then I got to work using the call and parsing the data returned from the “hot” posts on the particular subreddit I wanted. This will be continuously updated if I choose eventually to host this somewhere.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"a generated narrative device","date":"January 30, 2022","description":"sketch #1 documentation"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/catn/assignment-1/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/thesis/blog6/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"week 6"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/energy/setup/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"test documentation"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
