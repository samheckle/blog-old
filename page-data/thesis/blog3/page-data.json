I found that the language used was challenging and may be unapproachable to non-academic readers. It was reminiscent of Haraway, a very scientific read on what it means to live in a multispecies world.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Changes to the past don’t erase marks on bodies; the sedimenting material effects of these very reconfigurings – memories/rememberings – are written into the flesh of the world</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Barad discusses lightning, stingrays, and atoms themselves and the amount of evidence where weirdness, and queerness, and boundary defying ways in which they exist. </p>\n<p>The key here, for me, was on identity. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is no fixed dividing line between “self” and “other”, “past” and “present” and “future”, “here” and “now”, “cause” and “effect”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think that these will be a key focus in terms of content and story generation. I think that my stories will have themes pertaining not only to my interests, but the interests of the collective mind. If we think about randomness as a god, then are we thinking about how randomness impacts each and every living “critter”?</p>\n<p>Thinking about how I can curate content that is applicable in that sense will be a challenge, but I think it will be an interesting task to embark on. I might take this paper and use it as a part of the corpus, or I might only take a few key quotes from it that might be applicable to the themes. This might be how I go about creating the corpus — using my own academic research and curating the specific parts to feed into the machine.</p>\n<h2>Some other articles that I perused but didn’t comprehend</h2>\n<p>These were on recomendation from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/darnyill/\">@darnyill</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aqnb.com/2021/08/22/jenna-sutela-for-new-mystics-bacteria-wetware-psychedelic-silicon-valley-in-the-latest-from-the-artist-ai-collaborative-writing-project/\">Jenna Sutela</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.aqnb.com/2021/09/22/lawrence-lek-for-new-mystics/\">Lawerence Lek</a>\n<a href=\"https://mouthofdarkness.online/\">Mouth Of Darkness</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Researching Further","date":"November 22, 2021","description":"thinking thoughts a little harder"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/thesis/blog3/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/biomaterials/week-4/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Week 4 Assignments"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/networks/final/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Building a Router"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
