<p><em>Animism -</em> coined in 19th century to designate projection of human attributes, first meaning rooted in Western perceptual experience of indigenous oral people</p>
<p>Perception is relational (ie capture our attention), focus on things we have been transformed by</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Perceiving self is not a disembodied mind but rather a bodily subject entirely immersed in the world it perceives</p>
<p>perception happens involuntarily — it is more immersed in the world around us because it is observing constantly despite our focuses and distractions. our <em>focus</em> may not be necessarily on whatever object, but our perception will notice regardless
we are susceptible to habituating to our environments and not noticing, but our perception always will (afai understand i’m not totally sure here</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>being a part of an environment is not only us having that specific experience, but also the environment simultaneously experiencing us</p>
<ul>
<li>perception = reciprocity</li>
<li>must be respectful towards the world, otherwise we risk “offend[ing] the very ground that supports us, and the winds and waters that nourish us”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Original definition of animism revolves around projection, which is inanimate and extremely direct</p>
<ul>
<li>contrasting indigenous definition which gives voice to the earthly world as the world discloses itself to humankind</li>
<li>animism wasn’t <em>invented</em> in the 19th century because it already existed as a form of communicating with the world around us</li>
</ul>
<p>Animism is embedded mode of perception
the world is a community of subjects of which we are also participants</p>
<p>Interesting to note the references (the person referenced writing the book on Alaskan tribes, the person writing the haiku, might be worth double checking this)</p>
<h2><em>Shamans</em></h2>
<p>humans who can communicate with other communities in the world, sensitive and susceptible to expressions from the “more-than-human”</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>communication happens by regularly shedding accepted logic of their culture to be able to relate to other shapes of sentience</p>
<ul>
<li>readily able to slip out of collective perceptual boundaries</li>
<li>but, the lowered boundary also means a higher boundary with people themselves ⇒ cannot shed culture without consequences</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>primary allegiance is to the earthly web of relations in which their human community is embedded</li>
</ul>
<p>On Disease (dis-ease)</p>
<ul>
<li>disease is conceived as a disruption or imbalance, but does not lie in the individual person but the larger field where the person exists</li>
<li>dis-ease = discomfort of the affected person’s community</li>
</ul>
<p>Shaman is not central to culture despite narrowing the boundary between world and human community, rather the animate natural world </p>
<ul>
<li>worldview is “animistic” not “shamanistic”</li>
</ul>
<p>Modern Magicians </p>
<ul>
<li>medium = perception</li>
</ul>
<h1>Symbiogenesis, Sympoiesis, and Art Science Activisms for Staying with The Trouble, by Donna Haraway</h1>
<p>Sympoiesis = making with</p>
<ul>
<li>nothing is auto-poietic (productive)</li>
</ul>
<p>Holobionts = entire beings</p>
<ul>
<li>beings that are dynamically engaging other beings in complex patterns</li>
<li>they make each other through semiotic material involution</li>
<li>symbiotic assemblages → NOT host + symbionts, but everything is symbiont to each other in a NETWORK</li>
</ul>
<p>Symbiosis is not mutually beneficial</p>
<p>Margulis → new kinds of cells evolve primarily through the long lasting intimacy of strangers</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>symbiogenesis</em></strong> - basic and mortal life-making process</li>
</ul>
<p>Sympoiesis — collectively producing systems that do not have self-defined spatial or temporal boundaries (M. Beth Dempster)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even as these sciences lay the groundwork
for scientific conceptualization of the Anthropocene, they are undone in the very thinking of Anthropocenic systems that require both auto-poietic and sympoietic analysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Models = miniature cosmos</p>
<p>Involution powers Evolution</p>
<ul>
<li>rolling inward enables rolling outward, push and pull</li>
</ul>
<p>LOL SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD</p>
<ul>
<li>more response-able living and dying</li>
</ul>
<p>Anthropocene vs. Capitalocene vs. Chthulucene</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chthulucene = time-space of the sym-chthonicones</p>
<ul>
<li>to live and die well as mortal critters</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>humans and coral reefs as holobionts</p>
<p>what do we consider a holobionts and could the entire earth with all its cells inside it be considered one? or is it specific to system</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crochet Coral Reef</h3>
<p>experimental life form takes diverse shape when crafters create irregular rows</p>
<p>made out of so many different materials</p>
<p>stitches the materialities of global warming and toxic pollution</p>
<p>practicing multispecies in order to respond to problems</p>
<h3>Animism</h3>
<p>not about belief but practices of worlding, about sympoiesis and sensible materialism</p>
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>important definitions of inter-connectedness of symbiotic systems and holobionts</p>

<h1>Language of Animacy (Braiding Sweetgrass) by Robin Kimmerer</h1>
<p>Puhpowee = force which causes mushrooms to push up from the earth overnight</p>
<p>breathe life into the language</p>
<p>many different verbs to represent living things — inanimate objects are nouns if the original noun is dead</p>
<p>loss of objectivity happens when adding he/she to a study object</p>
